What is ISO image?   
     - a 'Digital replica of the disk'  
	 - a single file that contains a complete copy of the data from an optical disc, like a CD or DVD, including the file           system and all the files and folders.  
     - ISO image is mountable which means it can be made visible to the operating system by attaching it to a specific              location in the file system.

       - (U)EFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
       - firmware in non-volatile memory which starts first when computer is powered on and loads bootloader (e.g.GRUB) which in turn loads linux kernel and starts OS
